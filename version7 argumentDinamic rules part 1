#So we actually can delete the duplicate function/mark and just insert the new fiture in the copy/paste mark because the duplicate actually can copy and paste several time 
#same thing but with dinamic argument and different functions that take different argument for example function1 can take all the part-block that we insert to the paste in order
#to discover more marks that consider internal mark in the copy (and in generly we actually called to mark and function that site on the mark that we catch internal marks and 
#functions )<- and that actually say that the default-mark that we read directly in the block and keep and check what we need in several beginning functions and keep in the 
#form how we need according the indtruction of the default-mark and after in the oop classes perform we actually analyze everything and perform what we need . So we actually do
#everything that consider spacial according the request in the interanl-function and internal-mark the default mark do actually very simple things such as copy and paste 
#short things... but the internal thing like the spacial arguments and the function that take the spacial argument that consider argument or argument that consider argument 
#because we put the function that read the charecter/s like arguments.


#that can say about the way that we go on we actually we recognize the "big-mark" the default mark and check
#it and keep in the form in spesific place and in the spesific way that mean actually we have condition category that we can put the mark and save different part of and after 
#we can perform all the things and first the instruction of the default mark and after the function argument and more according the request and the instruction and just insert
#the wanted things in the block or the part of the block that we catch or in the place that we modify and send as massege .

#after we know the process of every modify in the system and approximately how the client get it we understand that we need to put as well as the argument we want to modify
# in the place that we paste the catching-block or something like this we need to say which condition we will turn on this functionality about the block or add or do 
# some kind of modify on the argument according the condition like argumentId?(+=)!(+1) or argumentId?(function1) . So in this way we actually say before all the activates 
#about the argument that we want to do we can simply say the situation that we want to do this process about the spesific argument . 
#The math in order to find the tiwch  of {} in block -> i need this math in order to understand more clear where i need to put the varible or to do this action on the varible/
#object so we just need the index of the ({) and after the next (}) , but if in the same block found more ({) we need the next next (}) and etc... this code will be like this :

# when we insert something in the block or in the catch(the place that we "catch" with the open and close tag with the default-mark)
#with function according the value and condition or in other word every when we insert or modify argument we have several of mendedory that we must do in order to do it 
# pefect and in the currently argument/s :

# first we will use in the loop for in order to recognize the index of the { } that suit for together after we need to insert the argument or modify that we choise for 
#dinamic and we put them not in the sub-function i.e don't belong to the catch but this argument can be in catch-place simply don't blong to this place and don't need to insert
#or get modify with the default-mark that close about this place like (a) argument the default argument that insert in the beginnig
#So in shortly i said about we have tow type of argument that blong to catch and the regolary argument 
#and we will insert and modify the argument that ordinary in the beginning and the sub argument that blong to some kind of catch class in the same way 
#we will check the condition of the argument and the type of the argument (let's assume that in ORD argument he need to be in the extend(איקף) of the block)
# and active the instruction way , so if we need to be in the extend of the block we need i.e ORD argument we need every catch or place that we cheracter to create list of
# indexs for tiwch of { and this } and every time insert or modify or do something but the issue is to know the change of the lengh argument and after do :
# A(the number that we need to increase or decrease all the {} tiwch constitunet-list) = B(length_argument_rightNow_old) - C(length_argument_rightNow_old) 
#and after change all the number in this constitunet-list of index ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ why we need actually to know the limit of the block ? because if we insert the 
#argument and (most of the time that whene we will use in arguments we will do some insert or modify but in inserting way ) we need to suit the value to argument in the 
#wanted block due to we need to know the index of the { and the suit close } before we take care about the next argument/s and every time the index get change because we insert
#thing/s in different length .
#the placement will something simple like this:
"""
for twich in institunetTwichListOld:
    for index in twich :
        index+=A(The bonus number can be +/- netural)
        institunetTwichListNew.append(index)
    institunetTwichListNewOld.append(institunetTwichListNew)
    institunetTwichListNew=[]
institunetTwichListOld=institunetTwichListNew
"""
#And the area for this value or for this doing on the argument will be something like this 
"""""
for index in dictionaryPair.open:
  space=argumentIndex-dictionaryPair
  list.append(space)
find_positive_number(list):
  positiveList=[num for num in list if num > 0]

"""""
#The new idea about the system of the blockFunction that will bring more easier for the client and for the us (programers) :
#we will append to the data-block place for (marks) and instructions with spacial id for everyone of them .
#And in this way we actually can short the requests , instead of to write for example on some kind of catch place in the block instructions and spacial thing we actually 
#write it in spacial place in data-block and just say we want to use in this instructions according the id .
#For example of this situation that we can use in this fiture : <--(idCopyFunction){block}-->  idCopyFunction(fucntion1(argument1) function2(argument2))
#We will insert the argument/sub-function in different way in this case every time basically we will build handler in the instruction about the thing that we will bind to 
#the catch with id for example if we want to take care about argument in or other type of sub-function we will build may condition that ask for example if the argument
#equal to something and if yes we will insert the argument with the function1 or something like this , the porpuse is to put the wnated value or the wanted thing in the 
#exactly place according what exist before after what it equal and more mark that we decide according them, and response with our instructions .

#In this way everything will be very easy because we will response with the instruction and fit it to id , that true exist default thing that get perform and behave first in 
#one way , but we can combine this defualt behavior in some thing and our behavior with instruction and also with argument or some kind of sub-function 
#So this system will build like this : we will put several mark and we know that they have type of behavior that come on in default such as "copy" function at the other place
#we connect with id spacial instruction also behavior for ->(argument or sub-function , but also they have default behavior such as connect to the copy catch with our 
#id for it) the behavior that we put in the "argument or sub-function" is just based on the nameOf mark id... and we just search it in the catch , of course not everyone have
#"catch" place like : copy-function , So if nothing we just need to put this sub-function argument and bind it to the thing that we want with id , and after it we simply will
#search it in the catch of spesific thing , let's understand this topic with example :
# -->{(blockName(optional),idPasteFunction),function1(argument1='123
# (So now in this way we just can put in this function that in the currently mark as argument or simply insert the ending value to the argument with name 
# argument1 or if nothing argument in this function it take all the block copy or the catch and perform the function about it 
# in shortly we actually see that prefer to use in the instruction at the block-data to say what we exactly wnat and how)'))}<--
#So in this case if we want modify and perform things on the copy catching idPasteFunction(idargument?('Elior')!(function1(idargument),
# idargument?([3]->+=1)!(modify spesificArgument\numberCatch("the number or condition and the")[0][condition[0].index(1)] put 2))) 
#^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ In this case we saw actually how we create spesific condition for argument according id first after we put the wnated things according index and the condition
#that should anough flexabilty in this case(placement argument and sub-function according the conditions) .
#several fixes in this case that can get more relevant:
#We actually can aim to spesific place like (condition[0]) , so we can take this idea and create more flexability we can create "pain" and give the id and after we check 
#condition or something like this for argument or some thing we will can aim and change the "pain" and even aim exactly where we want to bring change in the relation or the 
#pain thing 
#that idea bring more flexability to the system because instead of aim where we want to change the thing according the nuber of condition that in the qestion or more over 
#we can for example change the argument or the guy that we want to "modify" and say we want this and this to modify because it uphold the condition (and) exist "pain" about this
# thing and more and more situation that we can simply do in really simple mark . 
#the condintion of the argument can be something like this :



#(argument.tag.id="tagId")
#1: (argument.id="argumentId")?([0]->+=^This before^1^This after^)~([1]<-1^tow^2^towAfter^)!(modify before in condition[0] "^This after^" after "^This before^" catch 1 equel 2
#,modify after ^tow^ before ^towAfter^ condition[1][condition[1].index(2)]=3,...)

#We need to follow about the variable/object/element and the place that for and decide if check and perform or not . 
#Despite we actually can't put any of the sub-function in the condition, because if we actually want want to put id of any sub-function and care about it we can simply create a
#new statment of conditions and performs . So instead in order to make flexability in our system and check condition in more dinamic way we can use in our attribute that we created
#the (^) with it we will can mark place for condition to start check from i.e we will create mark and from there we will start to search the spesific thing as well as we will
# add id/class... other things that we can catch and change and what ever like this for the same condition/s and afer in the preformer this will allow to catch what we want

# for example to the 2new ask : (argument.id="Aid",tag.id="tagId")?(argument itself(automaticaly)[80-120]<-"^Elior^"[1]<-+=1)!(modify in condition[0] [argument[0]+argument[1]]=123\all=123)
#let's break this down : we actually say in this case that we want to modify or something else to do in the !(...) , after we actually "range" from the catching thing 
#like this argument.id="Aid",tag.id="tagId" and put type of "if" exist in this range and behind the catching thing because (<-) and after we say the same thing on the 
#  "^Elior^"" if we found it in the range we will search behind one "-+=1" and if everything happned we change (all) the argument or sub-function that we catch to 123
# and in the deliberately we aim to condition 1 and use in (modify) method . 

#example 2:
#(argument.id=1,tag.id=2)?([0-20]->^simpleMark^[0]<-"Elior the king")~([0]->"Banda")~("Elior")!(in condition[0]  after "->" before "<-")  
                                                                    #^ "and" for our system^^ the argument or wanted thing it self is eqeul to "Elior"
   #What is going on with ^something^ : that actually our way to say "this the guy i want to modify/something else and the beautiful thing in this solution is ->(in our system
   # that read the block and etc... we delete the ^^ and everything that in , so we can use this "mark" in order to mark the spesific thing and after we modify the argument
   # or somthing else or do everything elese we delete it and that isn't disturbing )" and this how we "catch" the 1 from exact place.
   
   #the explantion  for example one is : in the beginning " (argument.id="argumentId")" we say that we want to see in this case at the block the argument with this spesific
   #id , after we create to condition by the way because of this we put in the activate place this !(...) condition[0] and condition[1] in the condition one we write
   #([0]->+=^This before^1^This after^) let's break down ([0]) that mean "we want to check the something direct after or behind the argument with this id " the (->) mean 
   #"I want to search it after this argument" and after is just the describe about what we actually want after "+=^This before^1^This after^" the "and" condition (by the way 
   # "~" say "and" in our system) "([1]<-1^tow^2^towAfter^)" ([1]) say we beginning to check the wanted thing not dirctly like the previous condition , one more char in order
   #and the (<-) say behind , 1^tow^23^towAfter^ say simply what we wnat in the condition (for clearly this the condition 12 simply the things with ^ for say the system 
   #we want something between both and contrast between more 23 if was in the same condition)
   #so after we just say what we want with really simple instructions (after the ! mark of course) : (modify before "^This after^" after "^This before^" catch 1 equel 2
#,modify after ^tow^ before ^towAfter^ condition[1][condition[1].index(2)]=3,...)

#2 example with 

#More innovetive to the "tag" , we can buker thing with the tag and simply change them and modify them that mean we have actually tree condition to the "tag" one is in 
# the argument tow is just the tag and id and thing that we want in like example one and tow in suit and the three is actually can be the same with example 2 or something



#3 like this :idArgument?("Elior")!(function(idArgument)~(idT?("Banda")~containT("Elior The King")!(123))

#let's break every example down : 
# 1: we chack the argument say if direct ([0]) "after" (->) the  (idArgument) that     detemined ("it's (~) mean "and")
